Accompany Interview Project
===========================

To run, run `bundle install` and then `rackup -p 4567`. You'll need a
`client_secret.json` for Google's APIs in this directory. You'll also need to
change the base URI in `lib/calendars/google.rb`.


# Features Implemented
 - Support for primary private calendar (read-only)
 - Support for all private calendars, as well as shared calendars (read-only)
 - Toggle visiblity of each calendar within FullCalendar
 - Colour and default visiblity replication (one-way) from Google Calendar
 - Modular support for additional calendar (and contact) providers
 - Support for showing contact details on events with attendees

# Architecture

This project is mostly a single-page webapp which relies on a few routes on the
server to provide it with data, as well as a place for OAuth callbacks to go
to. The only page Sinatra renders in ERB is the index page -- all others are
either redirects, or JSON.

In order to make the front end modular, I used Backbone.js.
